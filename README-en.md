I am trying to let Perplexity AI create a small desktop application for me. 
This application is supposed to move files in a folder into folders designated for the extension based on the file extension.
It should be extendable to any file extension. 
If an extension is not yet available, the application should move the file into a default folder. 


I am a complete newbie, especially in Java, so I could use some help.
